# CPSC 3500 Computing Systems

For this course, the instructor graded mainly on functionality rather than code design, as computing systems largely emphasized conceptual details instead of code. Thus, a significant fraction of the necessary (pseudo)code was provided for each assignment, and it was the job of the students to extend the code to provide a functioning product. Since the professor and the graders found each of the listed assignments functional, they all attained grade of 100%.
