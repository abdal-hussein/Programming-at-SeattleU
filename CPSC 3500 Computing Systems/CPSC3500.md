### CPSC 3500 Computing Systems

The instructor grading mainly on functionality in this course, rather than code design. Thus, a significant fraction of the necessary (pseudo)code was provided for each
assignment, and it was the job of the students to extend the code to provide a functioning product. Since the professor and the graders found each of the listed assignments
functional, they all attained grade of 100%.
